**Intrinsic connectivity patterns of task-defined brain networks allow individual prediction of cognitive symptom dimension of schizophrenia and are linked to molecular architecture**

**Background** 
Despite the marked inter-individual variability in the clinical presentation of schizophrenia, it remains unclear the extent to which individual dimensions of psychopathology relate to the functional variability in brain networks among patients. Here, we address this question using network-based predictive modeling of individual psychopathology along four data-driven symptom dimensions. Follow-up analyses assess the molecular underpinnings of predictive networks by relating them to neurotransmitter-receptor distribution patterns.

**Methods** 
We investigated resting-state fMRI data from 147 schizophrenia patients recruited at seven sites. Individual expression along negative, positive, affective, and cognitive symptom dimensions was predicted using relevance vector machine based on functional connectivity within 17 meta-analytic task-networks following a repeated 10-fold cross-validation and leave-one-site-out analyses. Results were validated in an independent sample. Networks robustly predicting individual symptom dimensions were spatially correlated with density maps of nine receptors/transporters from prior molecular imaging in healthy populations.

**Results** 
Ten-fold and leave-one-site-out analyses revealed five predictive network-symptom associations. Connectivity within theory-of-mind, cognitive reappraisal, and mirror neuron networks predicted negative, positive, and affective symptom dimensions, respectively. Cognitive dimension was predicted by theory-of-mind and socio-affective-default networks. Importantly, these predictions generalized to the independent sample. Intriguingly, these two networks were positively associated with D1 dopamine receptor and serotonin reuptake transporter densities as well as dopamine-synthesis-capacity.

**Conclusions** 
We revealed a robust association between intrinsic functional connectivity within networks for socio-affective processes and the cognitive dimension of psychopathology. By investigating the molecular architecture, this work links dopaminergic and serotonergic systems with the functional topography of brain networks underlying cognitive symptoms in schizophrenia.
