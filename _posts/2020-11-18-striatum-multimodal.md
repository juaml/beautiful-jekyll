We developed a new multimodal method and applied to to create convergent parcels of the human striatum.

**Joint Multi-modal Parcellation of the Human Striatum: Functions and Clinical Relevance**

**Abstract**

The human striatum is essential for both low- and high-level functions and has been implicated in the pathophysiology of various prevalent disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD) and schizophrenia (SCZ). It is known to consist of structurally and functionally divergent subdivisions. However, previous parcellations are based on a single neuroimaging modality, leaving the extent of the multi-modal organization of the striatum unknown. Here, we investigated the organization of the striatum across three modalities-resting-state functional connectivity, probabilistic diffusion tractography, and structural covariance-to provide a holistic convergent view of its structure and function. We found convergent clusters in the dorsal, dorsolateral, rostral, ventral, and caudal striatum. Functional characterization revealed the anterior striatum to be mainly associated with cognitive and emotional functions, while the caudal striatum was related to action execution. Interestingly, significant structural atrophy in the rostral and ventral striatum was common to both PD and SCZ, but atrophy in the dorsolateral striatum was specifically attributable to PD. Our study revealed a cross-modal convergent organization of the striatum, representing a fundamental topographical model that can be useful for investigating structural and functional variability in aging and in clinical conditions.
