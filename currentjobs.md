**Postdoctoral position (open)**

Postdoc position in machine learning for brain connectomics at the Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine, Research Center Jülich, Germany!
A postdoctoral position in machine learning for brain connectomics is available at the Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine, Brain and Behaviour (INM-7) with Prof. Dr. Simon Eickhoff and Dr. Kaustubh Patil within a project under the DFG-funded priority program *SPP-2041 "Computational Connectomics"*. The position will be for 2 years with a potential for extension.

The primary duties of the postdoctoral researcher will be to build predictive models using large neuroimaging datasets and write manuscripts for publication. As a postdoc, you will have the opportunity to develop and apply skills in cutting-edge machine learning and artificial intelligence methods (e.g., deep learning) and neuroscience to understand the typical and atypical brain ageing and assist in supervision of junior (MSc and PhD) researchers. You will work in a highly motivated inter-disciplinary team and contribute towards general aims of the institute. We have access to state-of-the-art CPU and GPU clusters at the Jülich supercomputing center. 

You should have a PhD in one of the related fields. Applications from any related area (computer science, neuroscience, physics, bio-medical engineering) are encouraged, especially from individuals who have an interest in predictive modelling using neuroimaging data. The ideal candidate will have demonstrable expertise in machine learning/artificial intelligence and/or optimization methods as well as programming (especially Python, R and Matlab). A background in neuroscience and/or neuroimaging analysis is a plus. Good English communication and writing skills and a good team spirit are a must.

The position is available immediately and search will continue until a candidate has been selected. To apply, please send your CV (including a list of publications), a letter of motivation, and names of at-least two referees with the subject line “[postdoc application] SPP2021” to: [k.patil@fz-juelich.de](mailto:k.patil@fz-juelich.de?subject=[postdoc application]%20SPP2021).

The Forschungszentrum Jülich aims to employ more women in this area and therefore particularly welcomes applications from women. We also welcome applications from disabled persons.
