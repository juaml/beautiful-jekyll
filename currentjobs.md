A postdoctoral position in machine learning for risk stratification and outcome prediction in cardiovascular diseases and critical care medicine is available with Prof. Dr. Simon Eickhoff and Prof. Dr. Dr. Christian Jung. The position will be initially for 2 years with a potential for extension up to 4 years.

The primary duties of the postdoctoral researcher will be to build models using large datasets of clinical data and biomarkers including blood-derived as well as imaging data together with continuous monitoring of vitals (ECG, blood-pressure) to understand and predict relationships between them and patient prognosis. This project provides a unique opportunity for health-related data science, machine learning, and advanced modeling applied to real-world data.

The postdoctoral researcher is expected to write manuscripts for publication in scientific outlets. As a postdoc, you will have the opportunity to develop and apply skills in cutting-edge machine learning and artificial intelligence methods to clinically relevant questions and assist in supervision of junior (MSc and PhD) researchers. You will work in a highly motivated interdisciplinary team and contribute towards the general aims of the institutes. We have access to state-of-the-art CPU and GPU clusters as well as HPC at the Jülich supercomputing center. Several learning opportunities are available to develop technical and conceptual skills together with flexible remote working arrangements.

Applications from candidates with a PhD in any related area (computer science, physics, biomedical engineering, bioinformatics, computational biology) are encouraged, especially from individuals who have intermediate-to-advanced level of demonstrable programming knowledge (especially Python, R or MATLAB). An interest in predictive modeling is a must and experience with machine learning will be counted as a plus. An ideal candidate will have used biological data (medical imaging, omics data etc.) in their previous projects. Good English communication and writing skills and a good team spirit are a must. 

The position is available immediately and search will continue until a candidate has been selected. To apply, please send your CV (including a list of publications), a letter of motivation, and names of at-least two referees with the subject line “[postdoc application] MODS2022” to: k.patil@fz-juelich.de.
The institute aims to employ more women in this area and therefore particularly welcomes applications from women. We also welcome applications from disabled persons.
