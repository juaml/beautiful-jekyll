We use machine learning methods to answer neuroscientific questions with a focus on macro-scale organization and functioning of the human brain.
We are parimarily located in the [Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich](https://www.fz-juelich.de) and are part of the [INM-7 Brain and Behaviour](https://www.fz-juelich.de/inm/inm-7/EN/Home/home_node.html) institute and the [Institute of Systems Neuroscience](https://www.uniklinik-duesseldorf.de/en/institute-of-systems-neuroscience).
You can find more [details here](https://www.fzj.de/inm/inm-7/EN/Forschung/Applied%20Machine%20Learning/_node.html).
